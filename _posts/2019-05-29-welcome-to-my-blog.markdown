Hi there! Allow me to introduce myself.

My name is RÃºben Carvalho. I am a Computer Science student majoring in Network Engineering and I have a big interest in everything that is eye-candy. In this blog I will post my work and project development as well as tutorials in the scope of computer generated imagery.

Get aboard this awesome ride!
